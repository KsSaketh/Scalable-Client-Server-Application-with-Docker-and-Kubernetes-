# Scalable-Client-Server-Application-with-Docker-and-Kubernetes-
● Developed a robust client-server application, implementing features such as random server name assignment, multithreading for concurrent connections, and a timed loop for message delivery.
●	Demonstrated expertise in containerization by creating a Dockerfile for the server, ensuring seamless deployment and scalability using Docker.
●	Orchestrated the deployment of the server application in a Kubernetes cluster with a deployment.yaml file, managing a single replica for simplicity and efficiency.
●	Configured a NodePort service in Kubernetes to expose the server port, enhancing accessibility and connectivity for external clients.
●	Tested and validated the project by deploying it on a minikube cluster, showcasing the ability to handle increasing message delays with a rising number of concurrent clients.
